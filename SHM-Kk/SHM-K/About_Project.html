<h2>The Satellite Health Monitoring Tool</h2>
<p class="blockquote-text">It is a <b>Web-based Application</b> designed to track and analyze the health and performance 
	of satellites in orbit. This tool processes telemetry data from satellites to provide insights into their operational 
	status, including power levels, thermal conditions, subsystem performance and communication signal strength.</p>
<p class="blockquote-text">Post-launch satellite operations require software to continuously monitor and maintain functionality. 
	This tool assist the engineers in assessing the satellite health & ensuring optimal performance.</p>
<p class="blockquote-text">With the increasing number of satellites launched for various missions, the need for a robust 
	health monitoring system has become critical. The <b>Proposed System</b> aims to eliminate the inefficiencies by integrating 
	real-time telemetry data processing, predictive maintenance and automated alerts.</p>
