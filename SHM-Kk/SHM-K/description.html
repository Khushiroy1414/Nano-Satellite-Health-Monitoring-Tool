  <h2>Project Description</h2>

  <p class="desc-text">
    The <b>Satellite Health Monitoring Tool</b> is a web-based application developed to monitor, decode, and visualize real-time telemetry data received from satellites in orbit. The system is designed to process satellite data packets and present the extracted parameters in an interactive and user-friendly interface for engineers and students.
  </p>

  <p class="desc-text">
    This tool primarily focuses on displaying crucial parameters such as <b>Temperature</b>, <b>Battery Health</b>, <b>Signal Strength</b>, <b>Latitude</b>, and <b>Longitude</b> through live updating charts and graphical dashboards. It enables the user to decode both <b>binary packet files</b> and <b>text-based telemetry logs</b> received from satellite ground stations or TinyGS networks.
  </p>

  <p class="desc-text">
    In addition to displaying real-time values, the tool provides detailed information about the health status of each satellite. It helps users quickly assess whether a satellite is operating within normal parameters or if immediate attention is required. Features like dynamic graph generation, telemetry packet decoding, and data comparison charts enhance the usability of the platform.
  </p>

  <p class="desc-text">
    Developed using front-end technologies like <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js</b>, the system offers lightweight, responsive visualizations without requiring server-side resources. Future enhancements can include integrating cloud-based databases, historical data analysis, predictive anomaly detection, and automatic notification systems for critical alerts.
